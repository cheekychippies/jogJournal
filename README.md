Technologies Used in the Application

Firebase: I use Firebase services such as Firebase Authentication and Firebase Realtime Database. Firebase Authentication provides user login functionality, and Firebase Realtime Database enables real-time database storage.

Expo: Expo location, which allows for location tracking.

React Navigation: I use the React Navigation library for application navigation.

react-native-maps: The application features a map view, and I use the react-native-maps library for handling maps.

Modal: I use the react-native-modal library for creating modals.

@rneui/themed: It appears that you use the RNEUI library (React Native Elements UI), which provides ready-made UI components.

useEffect and useState: The React hooks useEffect and useState are extensively used for managing asynchronous operations and state management.

Async/Await: Your code uses the async/await structure for handling asynchronous operations, such as Firebase library calls.

TouchableOpacity: A component used in React Native that provides a "clickable" area that becomes transparent when pressed.
